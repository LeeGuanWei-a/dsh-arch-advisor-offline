## 1. One-Line Definition

Embedded firmware = **a tiny operating system plus a business state machine, running where "resources are locked down and errors have nowhere to escape."**

When a cloud program crashes you restart, scale out, roll back; firmware runs inside the lock on a user's front door — **a crash means the door won't open**. All of its architectural craft goes into three things: **layering to isolate hardware differences, state machines to tame concurrency, and sealing off the "failed upgrade" path for good**. It is the most extreme version of [designing for failure](https://github.com/study8677/awesome-architecture/blob/main/tutorial/12-为失败而设计.md) — because here there isn't even a "human reboot" to fall back on.

## 2. Business Essence: What Problem Does It Solve?

The brutal truth of the hardware business: **once a device ships, your marginal control over it approaches zero.** A firmware bug in the cloud is "roll back + apologize"; on hardware it's "recall a million units" or "the brand's reputation collapses."

Meanwhile, hardware margins are counted in pennies: shave a cent off the BOM (bill of materials), multiply by a million units, and you've saved real money. So firmware is forever asked to **do the most with the smallest chip** — RAM measured in KB, Flash in MB, power in μA. Every layer of abstraction has a real cost in memory and CPU, so **"do we need this abstraction" is an accounting question here**.

## 3. Core Requirements & Constraints

**Functional requirements:**
- [ ] Sensor sampling / actuator control (the device's actual job)
- [ ] Local interaction (buttons / screen / LEDs / voice)
- [ ] Wireless connectivity and reporting (BLE / Wi-Fi / cellular / LoRa)
- [ ] OTA remote upgrades
- [ ] Low-power management (the lifeline of battery devices)
- [ ] Self-recovery from faults (watchdog, power-loss protection)

**Non-functional requirements / quality attributes:**
| Quality attribute | Target | Why it matters for this kind of system |
|---|---|---|
| **Reliability** | Years of continuous operation (a watchdog reset is a backstop, not passing the bar) | Users will not "try restarting the door lock" |
| **Real-time behavior** | Critical responses deterministic at millisecond scale | Motor control 10 ms late can burn out a transistor |
| **Power** | Battery lasts months to years | Frequent charging = product failure |
| **Upgrade safety** | Brick rate ≈ 0 | Brick one unit, refund one unit; brick a batch, make the news |

**Key constraints (boundaries you cannot cross):**
- 🔴 **Resources are locked down**: RAM from tens of KB to a few MB, Flash from hundreds of KB to tens of MB, and none of it can grow after the device ships.
- 🔴 **No rebooting / updating at will**: the device is on the job (locking a door, riding down the road); update windows and failure budgets are tiny.
- 🔴 **No debugging in the field**: no SSH, no debugger — problems can only be solved with the evidence the device leaves behind by itself.
- 🔴 **Hardware iterates out of sync**: the same firmware must run on V1.0 / V1.2 / the V2.0 board that switched sensor suppliers.

## 4. Architecture Overview

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Application layer: the business state machine               │
│  (the device's life script: idle → working → fault →         │
│   recovery, event-driven)                                     │

│  interrupt management                                         │

│  change only this layer"                                      │
│   GPIO │ timers │ ADC │ UART/SPI/I2C │ radio TX/RX            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ▲ Watchdog: independent of every layer above — if the
       firmware goes silent, force a reset
     ▲ Flash partitions: bootloader │ firmware slot A │
       firmware slot B │ data
```

> The soul is this: **the HAL locks "hardware changes" into the bottom layer, the state machine locks "business concurrency" into the top layer, and the watchdog plus A/B slots catch "everything you didn't think of."** The service layer in the middle is the part every product rewrites and still gets wrong — which is exactly why it's worth writing correctly once.

## 5. Component Responsibilities

- **HAL (hardware abstraction layer)**: translates "turn on the LED" into the register operations of a specific chip. *Why it's needed*: chips go out of stock, get pricier, change suppliers; without a HAL, swapping the chip = rewriting all the code.
- **RTOS task scheduling**: preemptive, priority-based scheduling of multiple tasks. *Why it's needed*: motor control cannot wait for a log write to finish; priorities are how real-time behavior is implemented.
- **Business state machine**: models device behavior as "state + event → transition." *Why it's needed*: the king of embedded bugs is the "unexpected state combination"; a state machine makes every state explicit, enumerable, testable.
- **Watchdog**: an independent hardware timer; the firmware "feeds the dog" periodically, and a missed feeding forces a reset. *Why it's needed*: it's the last line of insurance against hangs — provided the feeding logic sits on a path the system only reaches when it is genuinely healthy.
- **OTA manager (A/B dual slots)**: new firmware is written to the standby slot, switched to only after verification, and rolled back automatically if boot fails. *Why it's needed*: upgrades are the number-one cause of bricking; dual slots turn "upgrade failed" into "back to the old version."
- **Log black box**: a ring buffer records key events; crash context (registers / call stack) is persisted to Flash. *Why it's needed*: with no field debugging, the black box is the only "autopsy report."
- **Power management**: orchestrates the rhythm of "sleep → wake → work → sleep again." *Why it's needed*: a battery device should be asleep 99% of the time; the power budget is allocated at the architecture level, not "optimized" in at the end.

## 6. Key Data Flows

**Scenario 1: One sensor event (interrupt → queue → task)**
```
1. The sensor fires a hardware interrupt
2. Interrupt service routine (ISR): does exactly two things — read the data,
   post a message to a queue (returns in microseconds)
3. The RTOS wakes the business task waiting on that queue
4. The business task feeds the message to the state machine:
   current state + event → new state + action
5. The action executes (drive an actuator / trigger a report)
   ── Iron rule: never do heavy work in the ISR; everything heavy
      gets queued and handed to a task
```

**Scenario 2: One OTA upgrade (the full closed loop that seals off "bricking")**
```
1. The cloud pushes an upgrade notice (version + signature + per-chunk hashes)
2. The firmware downloads in chunks to slot B (verifying as it goes,
   resumable after interruption)
3. Full signature verification → on success, mark "boot from slot B next
   time (trial mode)"
4. Reboot at an opportune moment (device idle + battery sufficient — never
   mid-job)
5. The bootloader boots from slot B → firmware self-check (can it reach the
   network? are the sensors OK?)
6. Self-check passes → commit "slot B is now official"; failure / another
   crash → the bootloader switches back to slot A automatically
```

**Scenario 3: The low-power cycle (a battery device's daily life)**
```
Deep sleep (μA level) ──RTC timed wake──▶ sample ──▶ batch up ──▶ only
power the radio to report once the batch threshold is hit ──▶ back to
deep sleep
── The radio is the power hog: connect rarely, send in batches, sleep
   immediately after sending — the three architectural moves of saving power
```

## 7. Data Model & Storage Choices

Core data: `firmware image`; `device config` (keys, calibration parameters, user settings); `runtime logs / crash context`; `pending-report data cache`.

| Data | Storage type | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Firmware image | Dedicated A/B Flash slots | The physical basis of atomic switching and rollback on failure |
| Device config | Small Flash partition, **dual copies + CRC** | Power loss mid-write must not lose the config; if one copy corrupts, the other survives |
| Runtime logs | RAM ring buffer + key events flushed to Flash | Flash has a wear limit (tens of thousands of cycles) — you cannot write everything to it |
| Pending-report data | RAM queue (optional Flash overflow area) | Buffer while offline, catch up when connectivity returns — offline-first, same as the [mobile app](https://github.com/study8677/awesome-architecture/blob/main/templates/mobile-app/README.md) |

> Flash is not a hard disk: **it wears out, writes by page, erases by block, and corrupts on power loss.** Every persistence design must answer "what happens if power dies halfway through a write?"

## 8. Key Architecture Decisions & Trade-offs ⭐

**Decision 1: Bare-metal super-loop, or an RTOS? ⭐**
- Bare metal (a `while(1)` polling loop): zero dependencies, minimal memory footprint, fully predictable behavior; but the moment tasks multiply, timing coupling becomes a disaster.
- RTOS: task isolation, priority preemption, a mature ecosystem; the price is a few KB to tens of KB of memory plus mental load (priority inversion, stack overflows).
- **Leaning**: with ≤3 features and no networking, bare metal is enough; **the moment "connectivity + business logic + low power" coexist, adopt an RTOS** — a small price for decoupled tasks.

**Decision 2: OTA with a single slot or A/B dual slots? ⭐**
- Single slot (overwrite in place): saves half the Flash; but **power loss mid-write = a brick**, with only a non-upgradable bootloader as a safety net.
- A/B dual slots: double the Flash, in exchange for "any step can fail and you still return to the old version."
- **Leaning**: mass-produced devices get A/B, no exceptions. Going up one Flash size costs a few cents to about one RMB per unit — multiplied by a million units, that is hundreds of thousands to millions — but a single brick-recall of 0.1% burns through more than that. **This accounting question works out.** If Flash truly cannot stretch, at minimum keep a dedicated recovery partition.

**Decision 3: Intelligence on-device, or in the cloud?**
- Cloud compute: cheaper device, iterable algorithms; but no network means a paperweight, and latency is uncontrollable.
- On-device compute: works offline, responds fast, better privacy; but chip cost rises and the algorithm is frozen.
- **Leaning**: **the "safety fallback" must be local** (a door lock must still open with the network down); experience enhancements can go to the cloud. The litmus test: after 24 hours offline, would the user still accept this device?

**Decision 4: How does one firmware serve multiple hardware revisions?**
- One firmware branch per hardware revision: clear, but versions explode and maintenance becomes hell.
- A single firmware that reads the hardware revision at boot and adapts dynamically: slightly larger binary, but one codebase, one production line.
- **Leaning**: single firmware + HAL-level adaptation + a board configuration table. **Branches are for "different architectures," not for "we swapped a sensor."**

## 9. Scaling & Bottlenecks

Embedded "scale" is not traffic — it's **device count × hardware revisions × years in the field**:

- **First bottleneck: field problems you cannot investigate.** 0.1% anomalies across 100,000 units = 100 angry users, and without logs it's a cold case. → Fix: black box + automatic crash-context upload + a remote diagnostics channel.
- **Second bottleneck: one OTA push takes down a whole cohort.** → Fix: staged rollout (1% → 10% → 100%) + a circuit breaker on upgrade failure rate + an observation window per batch — same as batch distribution in the [IoT platform](https://github.com/study8677/awesome-architecture/blob/main/templates/iot-platform/README.md).
- **Third bottleneck: SKU explosion, the firmware matrix spins out of control.** → Fix: HAL + config tables converge onto a single firmware; the production line uses one shared factory-test firmware.
- **Fourth bottleneck: Flash wear runs out (5 years into deployment).** → Fix: wear leveling, reduced log frequency, and an erase-cycle budget computed for a 10-year life from day one.

## 10. Security & Compliance Essentials

- **Secure Boot**: the bootloader verifies the firmware's signature; unsigned code does not run — keeping the device from being reflashed into a botnet zombie.
- **Firmware signing + encrypted transport**: OTA packages must be signature-verified, preventing a man-in-the-middle from slipping in a backdoor.
- **Keys must not lie around in Flash**: use the chip's secure storage / a secure element; one key per device, so that "crack one = crack all" cannot happen.
- **Lock the debug ports**: production firmware must close or lock JTAG/SWD (readout protection / authenticated debug / fusing) — otherwise you are handing the firmware binary over for free. Leave a path for RMA and failure analysis: "authenticated debug" (temporarily reopened with a key) is more common than one-shot permanent fusing.
- **Compliance**: wireless devices need RF certification (SRRC/FCC/CE); consumer data has privacy regulations; categories like smart locks carry mandatory safety standards on top.

## 11. Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Heavy work in interrupts (algorithms, packet sends, Flash writes)** → ✅ the ISR only grabs data + posts a message; heavy work queues up for a task.
- ❌ **Feeding the watchdog from a timer, so the dog gets fed while the main logic is dead** → ✅ the feeding condition = every critical task has checked in alive; only then does the dog mean anything.
- ❌ **OTA with no rollback — "we tested it, it will not fail"** → ✅ upgrade failure is not an if, it's a when: A/B + self-check + automatic rollback.
- ❌ **Casual dynamic malloc everywhere** → ✅ after months of uptime, fragmentation = a hidden bomb; the embedded convention is static allocation at boot, no malloc at runtime (or memory pools only).
- ❌ **Logging that depends on plugging in a serial cable** → ✅ there is no serial cable after the device ships: black box + remote upload is the production-grade answer.
- ❌ **Leaving "power saving" as a final optimization** → ✅ power is an architectural property: wake cadence, batched reporting, peripheral power sequencing are all design-time decisions.

## 12. Evolution Path: MVP → Growth → Maturity (how to set it up at each stage)

| Stage | Scale | How to set it up (specifics) | What to worry about now |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MVP / prototype** | Dozens of units | Bare metal or a lightweight RTOS; first make the sensor→actuator chain work end to end; OTA can wait, debug over serial | Validating hardware choices and core features — do not rush to build the skyscraper |
| **Small batch** | Thousands of units | Adopt RTOS + HAL layering; A/B OTA must be in place (from this batch on, you cannot take them back); a basic black box | The upgrade channel and the log channel — your last chance before they leave the factory |
| **Mass production** | 100K–1M+ units | Single firmware across hardware revisions, staged OTA + circuit breaker, automatic crash upload, factory-test firmware, Secure Boot fully on | Brick rate, return rate, SKU convergence, Flash wear budget |

## 13. Reusable Takeaways

- 💡 **The essence of a HAL is "locking your most unstable dependency into your thinnest layer"** — true for chips, and just as true for third-party APIs (same as the adapters in the [AI gateway](https://github.com/study8677/awesome-architecture/blob/main/templates/ai-gateway/README.md)).
- 💡 **The state machine is the universal weapon against "unexpected state combinations"**: explicitly enumerated states are far more testable than if-else scattered everywhere — payment order transitions (see the [payment system](https://github.com/study8677/awesome-architecture/blob/main/templates/payment-system/README.md)) are the same move.
- 💡 **A/B dual slots = the embedded edition of blue-green deployment**: any system where "an update can kill" is worth paying double the storage for "return to the previous version at any time."
- 💡 **"The ISR only posts messages, never works" = separating receipt from processing**: the same peak-shaving idea as web systems where "the entry point only enqueues, workers consume at their own pace."
- 💡 **Hard resource constraints force good design**: where memory is counted in KB there is no "pile it on now, optimize later"; that discipline of "budgeted architecture" benefits resource-rich systems just as much.
